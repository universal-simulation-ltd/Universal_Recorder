// The light/dark/system preference. The store itself lives in @unisim/sdk
// (createThemeStore, since 0.140.0) — this file only names the key. It opens
// LIGHT and stays light until the user chooses otherwise (the suite rule).
//
// ⚠️ The key is every user's saved choice. Renaming it silently resets them all
// to light. It is written down a second time in `index.html`'s pre-paint
// script, and `scripts/theme.test.mjs` (`npm run test:theme`) fails if the two
// ever drift.
