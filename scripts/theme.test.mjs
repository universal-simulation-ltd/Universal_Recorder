// `src/stores/themeStore.ts` names it for the SDK's store; `index.html` names it
// again in the inline script that puts `.dark` on `<html>` before the first
// paint, which is the only place early enough to matter (the store applies the
// same class, but not until the module bundle has parsed). There is no way to
// share one constant between a bundled module and a script that must run during
// head parsing — so instead, renaming either without the other fails here.
//
// It is not a style rule. The key IS every user's saved choice: change it and
// everybody who chose dark is silently back on light.

// Plain Node (no test runner), in the same style as `hostedPath.test.mjs`.
